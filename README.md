# AutoBot

AutoBot is a fun little web app I developed to learn the basics of web-scrapping using Puppeteer
 and Headless Chrome. 
 
 The application is designed to go to the specified website (It only works with the one as every
 e-Shop has a different webpage structure) and look for the specified item, add it to the cart
 and checkout all automatically and _hopefully_ faster then any human.
 
 I mostly made this because I like to buy cool limited clothing/shoes but its almost impossible
 to compete against others using similar bots to purchase items.
 
 ### Progess report:
 - <del>Accessing website and getting list of all items</del>
 - <del>Finding a specified item and accessing its product page </del>
 - Adding item to cart then going to checkout page
 - filling in shipping/billing information
 - hand controls back over to the user to confirm details and place order
